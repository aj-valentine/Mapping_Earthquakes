# Mapping_Earthquakes
Analysis Using JavaScript, GeoJSON APIs, HTML and CSS

## Overview of the Earthquakes Map Analysis :earth_americas:

The purpose of this analysis is to use JavaScript code to map and create dynamic visualizations of earthquake activity. This code contains different map layers (i.e. streets, satellite, and dark view) and allows the user to toggle with a filter to see different results. One layer of the map contains earthquake activity for the last 7 days. The second layer shows the tectonic plate lines around the world and the third filter displays only earthquakes with magnitudes of 4 or greater. The map code also created a legend in the lower right hand corner that provides information on magnitude by the color that it is represented by.
